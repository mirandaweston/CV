Full Stack Junior Developer trained at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech).

My background before coding exists at the intersection of global health and human rights, having obtained a BA in the former and an MSc in the latter, whilst working in national domestic abuse policy approached as a health issue and a human rights violation.

What began as a hobby became a catalyst for a reassessment of my career aspirations: coding is addictive, creative, and logical. It requires patience, self-discipline and a hunger to learn. The logic-driven ability to create something that previously did not exist is what keeps me coding.

I am looking for a Full Stack Junior Developer role where I can continue to write clean code and develop my programming knowledge in a growth-oriented environment.

## Skills

### Fast learner

- Learning to code developed my growth-oriented mindset and satiated my need for constant mental stimulation, aided by the principles of spiral learning.
- My ability to rapidly consume, retain and apply skills was required whilst working in Operations at Deliveroo at a time of technological change in how riders were onboarded to satisfy new compliance and legal requirements. I grasped and immediately applied new technical skills to suit an evolving start-up where processes were subject to change with immediate effect.

### Communicator

- Makers has consolidated my communication skills within a coding environment, particularly when reviewing each other's code, with an emphasis on pair programming from day one. Habitual collaborative learning engenders a deeper understanding of one's progress whilst working together to write cleaner code.

### Self-starter

- Self-motivation and self-discipline have been intrinsic to my coding journey. Makers catalysed the development of these attributes with its emphasis on self-led learning in preparation for everyday life as a programmer.
- Whilst working in Cabinet Office, I sought connections with Government Digital Service to network with software engineers and learn more about what it takes to be a coder.
